# bitronix-btm

The Bitronix Transaction Manager \(BTM\) is a simple but complete implementation of the JTA 1.1 API. The goal is to provide a fully working XA transaction manager that provides all services required by the JTA API while trying to keep the code as simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics. This is BTM's strongest point compared to its competitors: when something goes wrong it is much easier to figure out what to do thanks to the great care placed in useful error reporting and logging.
